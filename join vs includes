Sure! Let's take each example one by one and explain how `join` and `includes` behave in different scenarios.

### `joins`

The `joins` method is used to perform SQL `JOIN` operations. It is typically used for filtering records based on conditions from associated tables. However, it does not load the associated objects into memory.

#### Example 1: Basic Join

Suppose you have two models: `User` and `Post`, where a user has many posts.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

**Query: Find users who have published posts.**

```ruby
User.joins(:posts).where(posts: { published: true })
```

**Generated SQL:**

```sql
SELECT users.*
FROM users
INNER JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
WHERE posts.published = true
```

- **Behavior**: This query will return users who have at least one post that is published. It performs an inner join between `users` and `posts` and filters based on the `published` column of the `posts` table.
- **Note**: The `posts` association is not loaded into memory. If you access `user.posts`, it will trigger a separate query.

#### Example 2: Join with Select

**Query: Find users with their post titles.**

```ruby
User.joins(:posts).select('users.*, posts.title as post_title')
```

**Generated SQL:**

```sql
SELECT users.*, posts.title as post_title
FROM users
INNER JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id
```

- **Behavior**: This query joins `users` and `posts` and selects all user attributes along with the post titles. The result will include an additional attribute `post_title` for each user.
- **Note**: As before, the `posts` association is not loaded into memory.

### `includes`

The `includes` method is used for eager loading associations to avoid the N+1 query problem. It loads the associated objects into memory with additional queries.

#### Example 1: Basic Includes

**Query: Find users and their posts.**

```ruby
User.includes(:posts).where(posts: { published: true })
```

**Generated SQL:**

```sql
SELECT users.*
FROM users

SELECT posts.*
FROM posts
WHERE posts.user_id IN (list_of_user_ids)
```

- **Behavior**: This query performs two SQL queries: one to load users and another to load their posts. Rails then combines these results in memory. This avoids additional queries when accessing `user.posts`.
- **Note**: The `posts` association is loaded into memory, so accessing `user.posts` does not trigger a new query.

#### Example 2: Includes with Conditions

**Query: Find users who have published posts.**

```ruby
User.includes(:posts).where(posts: { published: true })
```

- **Behavior**: Similar to the previous example, but with a condition on the `posts` table. The users and posts are both loaded, and Rails filters the results to include only those users with published posts.
- **Note**: This can sometimes result in loading more data than necessary, depending on the dataset.

### Summary of Differences

- **Filtering and Efficiency**:
  - `joins`: Efficient for filtering based on associated table conditions. Does not load associations into memory.
  - `includes`: Used for eager loading to avoid N+1 queries. Loads associations into memory but can result in more data being loaded.

- **Loading Associations**:
  - `joins`: Associations are not loaded. Accessing `user.posts` will trigger additional queries.
  - `includes`: Associations are loaded. Accessing `user.posts` does not trigger additional queries.

### When to Use Each

- **Use `joins` when**:
  - You need to filter or sort records based on associated table conditions.
  - You do not need the associated objects in memory.

- **Use `includes` when**:
  - You need to access associated objects frequently.
  - You want to avoid the N+1 query problem.

### Example Scenario Comparison

#### Scenario: Display users with their published posts

- **Using `joins`**:

    ```ruby
    users = User.joins(:posts).where(posts: { published: true })
    users.each do |user|
      puts user.name
      user.posts.where(published: true).each do |post|
        puts post.title
      end
    end
    ```

    - **Behavior**: Efficient filtering of users with published posts. However, accessing `user.posts` triggers additional queries for each user.

- **Using `includes`**:

    ```ruby
    users = User.includes(:posts).where(posts: { published: true })
    users.each do |user|
      puts user.name
      user.posts.each do |post|
        puts post.title if post.published
      end
    end
    ```

    - **Behavior**: Avoids N+1 query problem by loading all associated posts in memory. Accessing `user.posts` does not trigger additional queries.

By understanding these differences and scenarios, you can choose the appropriate method based on your query requirements and performance considerations.
